    <h2>Bio of creator:</h2>
    Hi, my name is Shina Cortez and I am a 17 year old student/soccer player from Los Angeles, CA. Recently in March, I participated in the LA Marathon. Although I hate running, I really enjoyed the positivity people brought. I will be a senior at Hamilton High School, and I am looking forward to applying to colleges. I live at home with my mom, my brother, my step dad, and my dog Browny.
    I love art, video games, big dog lover, music and being around those I love/care about. I have an 11 year old Shih Ztu named Browny.<a href="https://instagram.com/notshina"> My instagram! </a>
